  abstract = {For a finite graph G with d vertices we define a homogeneous symmetric function XG of degree d in the variables x1, x2, ... . If we set x1 = ... = xn= 1 and all other xi = 0, then we obtain χG(n), the chromatic polynomial of G evaluated at n. We consider the expansion of XG in terms of various symmetric function bases. The coefficients in these expansions are related to partitions of the vertices into stable subsets, the Möbius function of the lattice of contractions of G, and the structure of the acyclic orientations of G. The coefficients which arise when XG is expanded in terms of elementary symmetric functions are particularly interesting, and for certain graphs are related to the theory of Hecke algebras and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.}
